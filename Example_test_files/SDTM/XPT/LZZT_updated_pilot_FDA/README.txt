This folder contains the mostly original set of SDTM datasets of the "FDA updated LZZT pilot",
an early SDTM submission that was abandoned and then donated to CDISC for use in pilots.

The define.xml file ("define_1_0.xml") is still a version 1.0 metadata file.

I will add a modern v.2.0 define.xml file as soon as possible (FDA only accepts 2.0)
